# spice

Spice is a zesty Chef API wrapper. Its primary purpose is to let you easily integrate your apps with a (Chef)[http://opscode.com/chef] server easily.  Spice provides support for the [Chef API](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Server+API)

## Installation

Install this beast via Rubygems:

    gem install spice
    
Of course, You can always grab the source from http://github.com/danryan/spice.

## Configuration

Spice has five configuration variables: 

    Spice.host          # default: localhost
    Spice.port          # default: 4000
    Spice.scheme        # default: http
    Spice.client_name   # default: nil. Must be set to a valid admin Chef client
    Spice.key_file      # default: nil. Must be set to a file path

To connect to a Chef server at https://chef.example.com:5000 with the "admin" API client, throw this somewhere your app can initialize:

    Spice.host = "chef.example.com"
    Spice.port = "5000"
    Spice.scheme = "https"
    Spice.client_name = "admin"
    Spice.key_file = "/path/to/keyfile.pem"

Say you had a Chef server (or Chef solo) running locally on port 4000 over HTTP, you only need to set your `client_name` and `key_file` path:

    Spice.client_name = "admin"
    Spice.key_file = "/path/to/keyfile.pem"


You can also use the Spice.setup block if you prefer this style:

    Spice.setup do |s|
      s.host = "chef.example.com"
      s.port = "5000"
      s.scheme = "https"
      s.client_name = "admin"
      s.key_file = "/path/to/keyfile.pem"
    end

After you have configured Spice, we need to create the connection object you'll use to sign your requests and pass them to the Chef server:

    Spice.connect!
    
If you want to reset your config to their default values:

    Spice.reset!

## Usage

### Low-level use

Setting up spice and running `Spice.connect!` creates a connection object that can then be used to send requests to your Chef server, accessed via `Spice.connection`.  

Get a list of all clients:

    Spice.connection.get("/clients")

Get a specific node by the name "slappypants":

    Spice.connection.get("/nodes/slappypants")
    
Create a new role called "awesome":

    Spice.connection.post("/roles", :name => "awesome")

Make the client "sweet" an admin:
    
    Spice.connection.put("/clients/sweet", :admin => true)
    
Scope out [the official Chef API docs](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Server+API) for a full list of wicked awesome things you can do.

## Contributing to spice
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
